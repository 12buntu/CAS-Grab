# CAS-Grab Inventory Manager

A tool to manage and automate inventory processes with the DDOMLab's ELN. Contains a variety of tools 
## Notes about Installation
- Make sure to create a file api_key so the program can interact with the ELN
- On Linux, the conda environment _should_ be enough to install all dependencies and make main.py runnable.
- On Windows, which is required to run the printer, the process to set up all the dependencies is a little more involved.
